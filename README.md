# Data Analysis & Visualization Project

As part of my final year at Hansraj College, I collaborated with an exceptional team to undertake a comprehensive data analysis and visualization project focused on the music industry. Our objective was to delve into various aspects of artist and listener trends, and to uncover insights that could inform both artists and platforms on optimizing content delivery.

This project not only enhanced my technical skills in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning but also underscored the importance of teamwork and effective communication in successfully completing a complex, multifaceted project.

I am excited to leverage these experiences and skills in a professional setting, where I can continue to explore the intersection of data science and the music industry or other dynamic fields.
